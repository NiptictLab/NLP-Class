\section{Faculities}
\subsection{Faculty of Information and Communication Technology}
Faculty of Information and Communication Technology of University of Technology (Yatanarpon Cyber City) is organized with competent instructors and enthusiastic researchers. We educate the students to be talented in their study areas and conduct innovative scientific research.\\
The students are being trained to have 21st century skills comprised of: collaboration and team work skills, creativity and imagination skills, critical thinking and problem solving skills. Due to their in-depth knowledge of information science and computer engineering, they are able to solve the real world problems faced within society in sophisticated way that lead to achieve work readiness skills. The Faculty is composed of two sub-departments.
\subsubsection{Department of Information Science}
Department of Information Science is recognized as one of the most prominent departments for theoretical and methodological reflection of computer science and information practice. The department is preparing the future generations of information specialists for managing communication flows, support of knowledge economy and handling the information explosion. Highly qualified instructors are exploring and doing research that contributes to the society by collaborating with Master and Ph.D. candidates.\\
The department encourages instructors’ involvement within the contemporary business world to enhance the quality of classroom instruction and contribute to students’ learning. After completing the study, students are capable of joining multinational companies in IT industry.

\subsubsection{Department of Computer Engineering}
 Computer Engineering Department offers high quality engineering education equipped with state of the art knowledge and skills to the students in order to become life-long learners, problem solvers and engineers with the scene of professional responsibility. The courses from our Department cover communication network, network security, embedded system and IoT. AI and Machine Learning and other ICT engineering related. These courses are delivered by highly qualified faculty members as well as researchers.
\subsection{Faculty of Precision Engineering}
Precision engineering and manufacturing issues are becoming ever more important in current and future technologies. Precision engineering is defined as painstaking attention to details and requires knowledge of a wide variety of measurement, fabrication, and control issues. Precision manufacturing is defined as the manufacture of individual pieces with extreme accuracy. This type of machining is used to make parts for various machines, including medical, aeronautical, and any other industry that requires identical parts to be created in large quantities.\\
Precision engineering is a sub-discipline of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, software engineering, electrical engineering, control engineering, and optical engineering. It is concerned with designing machines, fixture, and other structures that have exceptionally high tolerances, are repeatable, and are stable over time. This engineering field will aid in the advancement of various technologies that need to gain industrial competitiveness.
\subsection{Faculty of Advanced Material Engineering}
Materials that are utilized in high-technology applications are termed advanced materials. By high technology we mean a device or product that operates or functions using relatively intricate and sophisticated principles; examples include electronic equipment, computers, fiber-optic systems, spacecraft, aircraft, and military rocketry. These advanced materials are typically traditional materials whose properties have been enhanced, and, also newly developed, high-performance materials. Furthermore, they may be of all material types, and are normally expensive. Advanced materials include semiconductors, biomaterials, and “materials of the future” (that is, smart materials and nanoengineered materials). The properties and applications of a number of these advanced materials - for example, materials that are used for lasers, integrated circuits, magnetic information storage, liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and fiber optics need to study.\\
Processing, Structure, Properties and Performance are the main discipline of materials science and engineering and their interrelationship. There is a recognized need to find new, economical sources of energy and to use present resources more efficiently. Materials will undoubtedly play a significant role in these developments.
